# Binary Search Tree
## By Adrian Currington

### Description
This binary search tree stores integers whilst keeping the BST property that for a node v with left child w and right child y, w < v < y. The binary search tree will not store duplicate integers.  

### Files Includes
- main.h: Header file for my binary search tree.
- main.c: Implementation code for my binary search tree.
- tester.c: Tester code to test the functionality of each method in main.c.
- main.c.gcov: Shows the coverage of the main.c code when the tester.c file is run. 

### Run On Your Machine
I ran the tests with the following inputs to the command line:
1. gcc tester.c main.c
2. ./a.out
